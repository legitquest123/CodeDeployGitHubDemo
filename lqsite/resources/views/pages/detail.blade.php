                    <p id="1"><strong>Dr. B.S. Chauhan, J.</strong><br><br>1. This appeal has been preferred against the impugned judgment and decree dated 1.12.2009 in Regular Second Appeal No.2299 of 2009, passed by the High Court of Punjab &amp; Haryana
                      at Chandigarh, affirming the judgment and decree dated 16.9.2008, passed by the Additional District Judge, Amritsar in Civil Appeal No.122 of 14.6.2006 as well as the judgment and decree dated <a href="#"> 23.5.2006</a>, passed by
                      the Civil
                      Judge (Sr. Division) <a href="#">Amritsar in Civil Suit No.275 of 2004</a>, wherein and whereunder the courts have dismissed the suit of the appellant for grant of retiral benefits for not being Government servant.<br><br>2. Facts
                      and circumstances
                      giving rise to this appeal are as under:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p id="4"><span id="selectedfacts-1" tabindex="1">A. That the appellant had worked in the Army as Truck driver from 26.10.1962 to 10.1.1968. He was subsequently employed as a truck driver in the <a href="#">Fish Farmers Development
                            Agency from 16.7.1980 to 20.5.1998</a>. After being declared surplus, he was absorbed in the Animal Husbandry, Fisheries and Dairy Development, Punjab on 1.6.1998 and stood superannuated on 31.3.2002.<br><br><span

                            regularisation of ad hoc employees by absorbing them against the departmental posts. The said suit was dismissed vide judgment and decree dated 23.5.2006.</span><br><br>C.

                    <p id="2"><br>Hence, this appeal.<br><br>3. <span id="selectedargofpetitioner-1" tabindex="1">Shri D.K. Garg, learned counsel appearing for the appellant has submitted that as the appellant had been absorbed in the <a href="#">Fish Farmers
                          Development Agency</a>, he is entitled to take the benefit of entire service rendered in various places. Thus, the courts below committed an error in refusing the relief of pension and other retrial benefits. The appellant had
                        been given a hostile discrimination while a similarly situated person, namely, Charanjit Lal got a decree from the Civil Court, Gurdaspur on <a href="#">16.9.1996 in Suit No.4 of 1992</a> . Thus, the appeal deserves to be
                        allowed.</span><br><br>
                      <span id="selectedargofresponder-1" tabindex="1">4. Per contra, Shri Jagjit Singh Chhabra, learned counsel appearing for the State has opposed the appeal contending that the Fish Farmers Development Agency is a society registered
                        under the Societies Registration Act, 1860
                        (hereinafter referred to as Act 1860). If a civil court had granted the relief by mistake or the plaintiff therein succeeded in getting a collusive decree, which is contrary to law, its benefit cannot be extended to other
                        similarly situated persons for the reason that Article 14 of the Constitution is not meant to perpetuate an illegality. Thus, the appeal is liable to be dismissed.</span><br><br>5. We have considered
                      the rival submissions made by learned counsel for the parties and perused the record.<br><br>6. Before we proceed further, it may be pertinent to mention here that appellant after retirement had approached the High Court by
                      filing the Writ Petition No.1505 of 2004 (Chaman Lal v. State of Punjab &amp; Ors.) seeking relief of proficiency set up, against the State wherein the High Court refused the relief by recording a finding that the Fish Farmers
                      Development Agency, Amritsar was neither a Government agency nor a department but rather was a society registered under the Act 1860.<br><br>7. The Trial Court considered the issue of entitlement of the appellant for the aforesaid
                      relief and held as under:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p id="3">“Division Bench of Hon’ble Punjab &amp; Haryana High Court in the State of Punjab &amp; Anr. v. Shri D.N. Rampal, Deputy Advocate General, 1985 (1) SLR 14, where Hon’ble Punjab &amp; Haryana High Court held that Rule 3.12
                        provides
                        three qualifications for pension. It says that the service of a Government employee does not qualify for pension unless it conforms to three conditions l(i) the service must be under Government, (ii) the employment must be
                        substantive and permanent and (iii) the service must be paid by Government.<br><br>Counsel for the plaintiff argued that in the present case all three conditions are fulfilled so the plaintiff is entitled to regularization
                        of his services as per the provisions of Punjab Civil Services Rules, Volume-II, Rule 3.16, where the Govt. pleader for the defendant/State argued that the plaintiff cannot claim benefit of service rendered by him prior to
                        1.6.1998 as services rendered by him in Fish Farmer Development Agency from 20.5.1980 to 31.5.1998 was rendered by him in a society registered under the societies Act and regarding this fact a categorical findings has been
                        recorded by the Hon’ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in Civil Writ Petition No.1501 of 2001 between the parties and the copy of order is Ex.D3 perusal of the order of Hon’ble Punjab &amp; Haryana High Court in Civil Writ
                        Petition No.1501 titled ‘Chaman Lal v. State of Punjab &amp; Ors. shows that in that case also the question involved was that whether services rendered by the plaintiff in Fish Farm Development Agency, Amritsar can be considered
                        for the purpose of proficiency step up to the plaintiff and the Hon’ble Punjab &amp; Haryana High Court recorded a findings that the same cannot be considered for proficiency step up. The relevant portion of the findings
                        recorded by the Hon’ble Punjab &amp; Haryana High Court is reproduced as under:-<br><br>‘It has been stated in the preliminary objection that the petitioner was appointed in the office of Fish Farm Development Agency, Amritsar,
                        as a Truck Driver on a non-pensionable post. The Agency is a registered society under the societies Registration Act, 1860. It is an autonomous body. It is not a part of the department of Fisheries Punjab. In fact, the
                        petitioner
                        was appointed as a driver in the Department of Fisheries by the Director and warden only on 22.5.1998. In view of the above, no relief can be granted to the petitioner.’<br><br>So when the Hon’ble Punjab &amp; Haryana High
                        Court has recorded categorical findings that the services rendered by the plaintiff prior to 22.5.1998 was rendered by him in a society registered under the Societies Registration Act, then the plaintiff cannot be held to
                        be in service under the Govt. prior to 22.5.1998, so his service rendered prior to that date cannot be considered for the purpose of calculation of pension. So all these issues are decided against the plaintiff and in favour
                        of the defendants.”</p>
