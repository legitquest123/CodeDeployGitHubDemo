          <h4 class="font-weight-bold mb-3">General information</h4>
          <p>
              This policy sets out our privacy practices and explains how we handle the information we collect when you visit and use our site, services, mobile applications, products, and content provided by Legitquest, in existence now or in the future (“Legitquest Services”).
          </p>

          <p>
              A “Device” is any computer used to access Legitquest Services, including without limitation a desktop, laptop, mobile phone, tablet, or other consumer electronic device. This Privacy Policy governs your access of the LegitQuest Service, regardless of how you access it, and by using our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure and other uses described in this Privacy Policy. All of the different forms of data, content, and information described below are collectively referred to as “information.”
          </p>
        </div>


        <div class="mb-5">
          <h4 class="font-weight-bold mb-3">What we may collect</h4>
          <p>
              We may collect and store the following information when running the Legitquest Services:
          </p>
          <ol>
              <li>
                  Your Information. When you register an account with Legitquest, we start by collecting some personal information, such as your name and email address. We may also receive Personal Information (for example, your email address) through other users, for example if they have tried to share content from Legitquest with you or tried to refer Legitquest to you.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Log Data. When you use the Service, we automatically record information from your Device, its software, and your activity using the Services. This may include the Device’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, the web page visited before you came to our website, search terms you submit to our website, geographic location, identification numbers associated with your Devices, date and time stamps associated with activity on the website, system configuration information, metadata concerning file you upload to Legitquest’s public platform, and other interactions with the Service.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Cookies. We also use “cookies” to collect information and improve our Services. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your Device. We may use “persistent cookies” to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Service. We may use “session ID cookies” to enable certain features of the Service, to better understand how you interact with the Service and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on the Service. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all aspects of the Service.
              </li>
              <li>
                  When you create your Legitquest account, and authenticate via a third-party service like Twitter, Linkedin or Facebook, we may collect, store, and periodically update the contact lists associated with that third-party account, so you can connect with existing contacts from that service who are on Legitquest.
              </li>
          </ol>

        <div class="mb-5">
          <h4 class="font-weight-bold mb-3">Disclosure of your information</h4>
          <p>As a rule, we don’t share your personal information outside the company.</p>
          <p>We won’t sell your personal information.</p>
          <p>
              We may share your personal information with third parties in limited circumstances, including: (1) with your consent; (2) to a vendor or partner who meets our data protection standards; or (3) when we have a good faith belief it is required by law, such as pursuant to a legal process.
          </p>
          <p>
              If we’re going to share your information in response to legal process, we’ll give you advance notice so you can challenge it (for example by seeking court intervention), unless we’re prohibited from doing so by law or court order. We will object to requests for information about users of our site that we believe to be improper.
          </p>
          <p>
              If we merge with another company such that your information will become subject to a different privacy policy, we’ll notify you before the transfer. You can opt out of the new policy by deleting your account during the notice period.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-5">
          <h4 class="font-weight-bold mb-3">Changing or Deleting Your Information</h4>
          <p>
              If you are a registered user, you may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information provided in your registration or account profile. If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may update or delete it by making the change on your account settings. In some cases we may retain copies of your information if required by law. For questions about your Personal Information on our Service, please contact privacy@legitquest.in
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-5">
          <h4 class="font-weight-bold mb-3">Data Retention</h4>
          <p>
              We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you Services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services, you may delete your account by sending a request to delete your account to privacy@legitquest.in We may retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Consistent with these requirements, we will try to delete your information quickly upon request. Please note, however, that there might be latency in deleting information from our servers and backed-up versions might exist after deletion. In addition, we do not delete from our servers files that you have in common with other users.
          </p>
        </div>


        <div class="mb-5">
          <h4 class="font-weight-bold mb-3">Data Storage </h4>
          <p>
              LegitQuest uses third-party vendors and hosting partners, such as Amazon, for hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology we need to run legitquest.
          </p>
        </div>


        <div class="mb-5">
          <h4 class="font-weight-bold mb-3">Data security</h4>
          <p>
              We use encryption to protect data transmitted to and from our site. However, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure, so we can’t guarantee security. You use the Service at your own risk, and you’re responsible for taking reasonable measures to secure your account (like using a strong password).
          </p>
        </div>


        <div class="mb-5">
          <h4 class="font-weight-bold mb-3">Contacting Us</h4>

        <div class="">
          <h4 class="font-weight-bold mb-3">Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h4>
          <p>
              This Privacy Policy may change from time to time. If we make a change to this privacy policy that we believe materially reduces your rights, we will provide you with notice (for example, by email). And we may provide notice of changes in other circumstances as well. By continuing to use the Service after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.
